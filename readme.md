## A monza-spec To-Do App:
This is a simple python app for maintaining to-do lists.
<p>I could not find a simple, lightweight & ad-free To-Do List app. So created this.</p>
<p>The app is simple to use, has a negligible RAM footprint, and has no ads! You select the date from the calender widget and can then view/append/delete tasks. Or you can view 
all your tasks across multiple days. The tasks are stored in a json file.</p>
